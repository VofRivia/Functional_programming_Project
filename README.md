# Functional Programming Project 🤓💻

Welcome to my Functional Programming Project! 🎉  

This repo is me trying to dive into functional programming and figure out how to make my code look fancy and reusable. 

## What’s in Here? 📦

- Some working examples of functional programming. ✅  
- A lot of "work in progress" stuff. 🛠️  
- One or two failed experiments. 💀 

## How to Run This?

1. Clone this thing:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marielouisehanna/Functional_programming_Project
   ```

2. Get into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Functional_programming_Project
   ```

3. Run the Python files and cross your fingers. 🤞


## Work in Progress 🚧

Heads up: This is very much a *"learning by doing"* project. \ 🌀 If something doesn’t work, just laugh it off and blame the compiler. 😉



If you’ve got tips, ideas, or just want to point out my mistakes (kindly, please 🙏), feel free to jump in! Open an issue, send a PR, or just yell into the void.

Thanks for checking this out! Go on, give functional programming a try. It’s weird, but you’ll love it. Or maybe you won’t. Either way, happy coding! 💻✨
