# 🌐 Mini Programming Language Implementation

Welcome to our **Mini Programming Language** project! 🚀 Here, we’re building a custom language with the ability to interpret and execute commands, making it easier to perform specific tasks like sending emails, executing shell scripts, and defining our own custom commands.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project involves designing and implementing a simple programming language from scratch. It includes:

- **Syntax Parsing** 🌐 - Using parsers to define the syntax and rules of our custom language.
- **Direct Execution** 🚀 - Enabling commands to be executed directly within the interpreter/compiler.
- **Intermediate Code Generation** 🔄 - Translating language instructions into an intermediate format that can be executed efficiently.

Our goal is to explore the foundations of language design, parsing, and execution through this project. 💡

## 💻 Features

### 1. Syntax Parsing 🧑‍💻
We utilize parsers to define and interpret our language’s syntax. This allows users to write instructions in a structured, understandable format.

### 2. Intermediate Language Generation ⚙️
Our language translates commands into an intermediary code, which simplifies execution and makes it easier to expand functionality in the future.

### 3. Custom Functionalities 📧🔧
TBD
